## What is it?

SweetSpotter is a minimalist golf training aid designed to give you instant visual feedback on where you strike the clubface. It uses common materials — foam balls and reusable putty — to simulate impact and reveal strike location. It’s safe, quiet, and perfect for at-home practice.

## Why use it?

- ✅ No tech, no batteries, no noise
- ✅ Train indoors, even in small spaces
- ✅ Great for beginners, kids, or swing calibration before the range
- ✅ Cheap, repeatable, and actually kind of fun

---

## How it works

1. Stick a small dot of tacky putty to a foam ball
2. Hit the ball — it will briefly adhere to your clubface, showing where you made contact
3. Observe the smear or mark
4. Reference the cheat sheet (included in this repo) to interpret your impact pattern
