**A no-tech, open-source golf impact trainer using foam balls and tacky putty. Stick it. Spot it. Improve.**

**TS;WM** â€” *Too Short; Want More.* An inverse of TL;DR. You get the summary first. The rest is here if you're curious.

## What is it?
SweetSpotter is a minimalist golf training aid designed to give you instant visual feedback on where you strike the clubface. It uses common materials â€” foam balls and reusable putty â€” to simulate impact and reveal strike location. Itâ€™s safe, quiet, and perfect for at-home practice.

Note: While various commercial and DIY training aids exist â€” including foot spray and even a patented velcro-based solution from 2005 â€” SweetSpotter is distinct in its use of **reusable tacky putty** and **foam balls**, designed specifically for open-source distribution and non-commercial use.

## Why use it?

- âœ… No tech, no batteries, no noise  
- âœ… Train indoors, even in small spaces  
- âœ… Great for beginners, kids, or swing calibration before the range  
- âœ… Cheap, repeatable, and actually kind of fun

## How it works

1. Stick a small dot of tacky putty to a foam ball  
2. Hit the ball â€” it will briefly adhere to your clubface, showing where you made contact  
3. Observe the smear or mark  
4. Reference the cheat sheet (included in this repo) to interpret your impact pattern
